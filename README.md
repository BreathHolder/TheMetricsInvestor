## Structure Explanation

1. Root Folder
   - **README.md**: A standard readme file for the repository. It's describes my project on the GitHub repository homepage and helps me keep track of what is going on.
   - **_includes and _layouts**: These are Jekyll components. As I plan to use custom layouts or includes, they are needed and ypically stay in the root folder, as they aren't needed inside /docs.
2. /docs Folder (GitHub Pages Source)
   - **_config.yml**: Located in /docs, it configures Jekyll for my site.
   - **CNAME**: Ensures my custom domain (themetricsinvestor.buckeltag.com) is properly recognized.
   - **index.md**: This is my main page homepage content. GitHub Pages will convert this into the index.html.
   - **_posts**: Contains blog posts, with filenames in the format YYYY-MM-DD-title.md.
