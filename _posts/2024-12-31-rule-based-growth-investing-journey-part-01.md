# Unlocking Market Potential: My Custom Stock Screener Investment Journey

Investing can feel like navigating a maze, especially with the overwhelming number of options in the stock market. To simplify the process and make more informed decisions, I developed a custom stock screener using **Finviz.com**, a trusted platform for stock analysis. This blog marks the beginning of my five-year journey to evaluate the performance of a portfolio built on this screener—starting with an initial investment of $20,000 USD and adding $5,000 USD each month.

## What Is My Stock Screener and How Does It Work?

My stock screener is designed to identify companies with strong fundamentals and significant growth potential. By setting specific filters on Finviz.com, I’ve ensured that the screener highlights stocks with a balanced mix of growth, profitability, and financial health. Here are the rules that guide the screener:

1. **EPS Growth in the Next 5 Years**: Over 15%
   - Focus on companies with robust growth projections to align with long-term investment goals.
2. **Long-Term Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: Under 1
   - Preference for companies with manageable debt levels, ensuring financial stability.
3. **Sales Growth Over the Past 5 Years**: Under 15%
   - Targeting steady but not overly aggressive growth to avoid highly volatile companies.
4. **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Over 15%
   - Emphasis on companies with efficient management and strong profitability.
5. **Price-to-Earnings-to-Growth (PEG)**: Less than 1
   - Ensures the stock is undervalued relative to its growth potential, providing an opportunity for outsized returns.
6. **EPS Growth Over the Past 5 Years**: Over 15%
   - Confirms the company’s historical ability to deliver consistent earnings growth.
7. **Net Profit Margin**: Over 10%
   - Focus on businesses that maintain healthy profitability, translating to stronger bottom lines.

## Why These Criteria Matter

Each rule in this screener is designed to filter out noise and zero in on companies with solid fundamentals. Here’s why these metrics are important:

- **EPS Growth**: A high EPS growth rate indicates a company’s ability to increase its profitability over time, signaling strong potential for capital appreciation.
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: A lower ratio means the company is not over-leveraged, reducing the risk of financial distress during economic downturns.
- **Sales Growth**: Companies with controlled sales growth are often more stable and less prone to overexpansion.
- **ROE**: High ROE shows that a company uses its equity efficiently to generate profit.
- **PEG Ratio**: A low PEG ratio suggests the stock is undervalued, offering a favorable risk-reward balance.
- **Net Profit Margin**: Higher margins indicate better operational efficiency and profitability, crucial for sustainable growth.

## My Investment Strategy

The plan is simple but disciplined:

1. **Initial Portfolio Creation**: Start with a $20,000 investment, distributed across the top stocks identified by the screener.
2. **Monthly Contributions**: Add $5,000 to the portfolio each month, ensuring consistent growth while taking advantage of dollar-cost averaging.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Track portfolio performance monthly, analyzing gains, losses, and adherence to the screener’s criteria.
4. **Position Exit Criteria**: Evaluate each investment on a 12-month basis over the course of 5 years. If a position is negative by more than 10% at the end of any 12-month period, we will sell the position. Similarly, if a position is up more than 25% at the end of any 12-month period, we will also sell the position to lock in gains.
5. **Benchmark Comparison**: Compare results with major indices, such as the S&P 500, to evaluate the screener’s effectiveness.
